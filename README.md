# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Regression

### 🔬 Project Overview
This project aims to predict crop yields using supervised machine learning techniques, specifically regression models. It is designed to assist farmers and agricultural planners in making informed decisions based on climatic and soil-related data.

### 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Synthesized dataset for demonstration purposes
- **Features:** Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity, Soil Type, Crop Type
- **Target:** Crop yield (kg/ha)

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data handling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – Regression models and preprocessing  
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor

---

### ⚙️ Key Methods
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling nulls, encoding categories)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn
- Feature Selection & Scaling
- Model Training: Linear vs Random Forest
- Performance Metrics: MAE, MSE, R² Score

---

### 📊 Results
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **R² Score:** 0.89  
- **Observation:** The model significantly improves yield prediction accuracy compared to baseline averages.

---

### 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrate satellite/weather APIs for real-time prediction
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
- Expand to multi-crop and region-specific analysis
